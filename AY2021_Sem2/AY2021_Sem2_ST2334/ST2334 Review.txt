AY2019/2020 S2 (COVID Sem) WONG Yean Ling & CHAN Yiu Man

Module Difficulty/Contents:
> Should be manageable but messy and mistake-ridden notes is such a torture. I already did Stats in IB HL Math but had to relearn everything cos the notes (even if correct) taught it in a different style (ie Z_0.5 = P(Z>0.5) compared to P(Z<0.5), these sorta arbitrary standards mess up alot of stuff especially if you learnt it the opposite way already).

Workload:
> Not high, just make sure to pace your learning of the lecture contents well, especially if not following lecture.

Grade Breakdown:
> 30% Midterms Online Quizzes (x3)
> 70% Finals

Skip lecture:
> I guess? Lectures are slow and long. Alot of people say notes are comprehensive and easy to understand but i puked blood on alot of the notes so Id suggest you take it with a pinch of salt. If unsure, email the prof, they reply promptly.

Additional comments:
> use of GDC is not prohibited but many didn't use it, use it and you can easily get an edge
> the time allocated for all quizes and tests were really short. I ran out of time on many quizzes and finals, even the first prob quiz.. although Id learnt prob like a thousand times before. Good to take note and prepare to work fast.
> Please be nice and switch on your camera in zoom. The TAs talk to a just a handful of black screens so its pretty sad.
