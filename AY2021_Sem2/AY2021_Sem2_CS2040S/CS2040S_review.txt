AY2019/2020 S2 	(Prof Seth Gilbert)
Recitation	: Jin Zhe
TA		: Poh Lin Wei

Module Difficulty/Contents:
> Hard, struggled but was somewhat enjoyable (content-wise). Lots of pep say its conceptual and it is but in the end if you want to score well got to put in the time to consolidate the notes for easy revision before exams (cos its alot of stuff, going through ppt slides would be tough) 
> Lectures by Prof Seth were interesting and tutorials and recitations were well designed and engaging.
> Mainly Lecture Trainings (minimial time), Problem Set (1-2 days), Tutorials (0.5 day), Recitation (x)

Workload:
> High. Took on average about a 1.5 to 2.5 days to finish coursemology problem sets (weekly).
> Could almost never finish tutorial before it came out but good to at least bank a few qns so you can chip in (there are tutorial participation pts). Felt rly dumb but ig its the norm.

Grade Breakdown:
> not disclosed.

Helplines:
> Tutors
> Coursemology Forums
> Chat w Instructor aft recitation

Additional comments:
> Be nice to your TA and make friends in tutorial. Help each other out (don't share chunks of code though, in case they plagiarise, but share the general code idea)
> Lots of people do all practice qns on coursemology. Its gd practice ig but if you want the grades um they wont help cos in the end everyone hits the 35 level mark and gets the same amt of xp.

Grades:
> Expected Grade: B+
> Actual Grade: A
